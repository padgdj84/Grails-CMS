*****INTRO*****
The purpose of this project is to create the basic frame work for a groovy
grails based content management system. I will use grails scaffolding ability
to demonstrate how easy crud functionality is compared to struts/spring/beans.

*****Security*****
-Spring Security Core

*****Social*****
-Comments
-Voting
-Like/Unlike
-Profiles
-Articals

*****Management*****
-Dynamic form creation? (will be hard and dont know about usability)
-User Management. Want to try and intergrate this with already create
 user tables. This will allow the CMS to be intergrated into already 
 functional sites. (Less I have to worry about security / easier to
 intergrate) //Wow I just said intergrate a lot.
-etc.....

Can be a strong system if created properly. May be able to turn it into a
type of social networking generation framework. Allow any entry level developer
to create there own social network in minutes.
